Users can create their own styles and palettes simply by dropping new CSS
files in the relevant folders. In case of a file name collision, default
configuration is overridden. Default styles and palettes can be ignored
by adding new file names under 'general/ignored css' (settings.json).

Vim and QTermWidget palettes are also fully customizable. A typical
approach is to copy a file from the 'default' folders and to edit it.
